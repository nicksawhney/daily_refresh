# daily_refresh
An Google Assistant Action for mental health tracking and management

##Usage
Say "Okay google, talk to Daily Refresh"

Naturally tell the google assistant how you're feeling, for example "I'm feeling great", "I'm okay", or just "Fantastic"

You can also ask Daily Refresh to tell you how your week, month, year, past 2 weeks, and past 2 months have been. If mental health has improved over that period, Daily Refresh will tell you that. If it has not, you will be told the median of how you've felt during the time period.

##Applications
This google assistant helps take the pressure off mental health tracking, allows people to be cognizant when transitioning between psychoactive medication, maintains privacy, helps people avoid mental illness stigmatization, and encourages people to help themselves and be cognizant of their mental health. 

##Future
A website which positively and encouragingly displays data about your mental health (infrastructure present in code)
